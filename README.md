# Sentiment_Scores_From_News

## Project
* I want to use bs4 to do some webscraping and sentiment analysis using vader
* Nursing Home ratings are not substantial and dont reflect the state of the home (more info on this on the actual repo tba)
* The NYTimes reported on March 13, 2021 that their investigation, shows that federal "star system" is broken 
* Please see [this NYT article](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/13/business/nursing-homes-ratings-medicare-covid.html) for more info!
* Hence, the idea of this project is to create a tool, that when given the name of a nursing home, can scrape the titles of 
news articles from a set date range and tell you if they are mostly positive, negative, or neutral
* The idea is that the aggregation of news articles and their resulting tones, can help enhance people's their decisions

## Results
* Currently, I'm using streamlit to display the data. It's an amazingly easy and fast tool to display the results! 
* You can check it out by downloading this project and running "streamlit run main.py" in the folder. Enjoy!
